# Video Rentals Application

This project was done to explore the fundamentals of ASP.NET & ASP.NET MVC & ASP.NET WEB API.

What I've learned and explored during the development of this project:
  - Understand the MVC architectural pattern
  - Implement CRUD operations
  - Build forms with server-side and client-side validation
  - Build RESTful services using ASP.NET Web API
  - Use powerful jQuery plug-ins
  - Implement authentication and authorization using ASP.NET Web API
  - Use Entity Framework to query or update data
  - Understand and apply security best practices
  - Build and deploy applications
  - Create and customize build configurations
  - Manage client / server dependencies
- Test APIs using PostMan
- Use AutoMapper
  
  
# Summary
Here I've used the following aspects / architecture:

1. ASP.NET MVC FUNDAMENTALS:
  - Action Results;
  - Action Parameters;
  - Convention-based Routing;
  - Attribute Routing;
  - Razor Views;
2. Entity Framework Fundamentals of Code-first workflow:
  - Code-first Migrations;
  - Seeding the Database;
  - Overriding Conventions;
  - Querying Objects with linq expressions;
  - Eager Loading (*lazy loading sucks and is MUST not be used*);
3. ASP.NET MVC FORMS:
  - Markup (Razor);
  - Overriding Labels;
  - Rendering drop-down lists;
  - Adding data;
  - Updating data;
    - View Models;
4. Validation
  - Data Annotations;
  - Custom Validation;
  - Client-side Validation;
  - Anti-forgery tokens;
5. Building Web Apis (using ASP.NET WEB API FRAMEWORK)
  - Postman (testing api);
  - Data Transfer Objects;
  - Auto Mapper;
  - Camel Notation configuration for apis
6. Client-Side Development (consume web apis)
  - Call APIs using jQuery Ajax;
  - Bootbox plugin;
  - DataTable plugin;
7. Authentication and Authorization (ASP.NET IDENTITY)
  - Authorize attribute;
  - Seed users and roles;
  - Extend ASP.NET Identity users;
  - OAuth and social login;
8. Performance Optimization
  - Data tier;
  - Glimpse;
  - Output Cache;
  - Data Cache;
  - Async;
  - Disabling session (no longer used throughout the internet, old)
  
# "Premature Optimization is the root of all evils" - Donald Knuth

9. NEW RENTALS FEATURE
#-Systematic Approach
  - Understand the problem
  - Start with the backend
  - Think of the inputs and the output
  - Declare a simple API
  - Extend the domain model (if required)
  - Build the happy path
  - Add the details one by one

10. Deployment
  - Deploying the application
  - Deploying the database
  - Build Configurations
  - Application Settings
  - Securing Configuration Settings
  - Custom Error Pages
  - Logging Unhandled Exceptions (ELMAH plugin)
  - CSS Styling
